# GameBoardXX
GameBoardXX is a tile based board creation library for digital board games.

## GameBoardXX File Format
Different GameBoard format variants exist:
- GameBoard64 (GB64, 64 bit tiles) 
- GameBoard32 (GB32, 32 bit tiles)
- GameBoard16 (GB16, 16 bit tiles)
- GameBoard08 (GB08,  8 bit tiles)

GameBoard64 represents the highest detail a tile can have, all other GameBoard formats will compromise features for storage efficiency.

Game Board file extensions are GBXX where XX is the number of bits per tile.

### Board Header
The first 8 bytes of any GameBoardXX file stores critical Board information.
